<h5 id="theory">Theory</h5><p><strong>Agents</strong> are specialized services that handle specific tasks like checking data, applying business rules, or creating content. They work by talking to LLMs or external APIs. Each agent uses <em>clear input and output formats</em> (usually JSON), which makes them modular, easier to test, and simple to connect with other systems. By linking several agents together, we can build applications with multiple steps.</p><p>In this project, we're creating an AI Diet &amp; Meal Planner - a FastAPI app with multiple Agents that makes meal planning much easier. Our system will use three agents:</p><ul><li><p>Inventory agent, which processes and checks the food items you already have</p></li><li><p>Diet agent, which filters ingredients based on your dietary needs (like vegan or keto)</p></li><li><p>Planner agent, which creates complete, ready-to-cook recipes using your available ingredients</p></li></ul><p>The whole system will work as connected FastAPI endpoints that talk to each other through JSON. The goal is to take away the daily headache of figuring out what to cook by giving you personalized recipes based on what you like and what ingredients you have on hands.</p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Before we get to the agents, we need to set up a working FastAPI application with a clear structure and a simple health-check endpoint. This be used as a base for our application.</p><p>In this stage, your job is to create a simple FastAPI service with a health-check endpoint (<code class="language-shell">GET/</code>) that returns a JSON response showing the server is working properly. This step makes sure your development setup is configured correctly, setting you up for the more complex features we'll add later.</p><p>Here is the file structure you can use for this project (we will populate the files along the way):</p><pre><code class="language-shell">├── agents

</code></pre><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>This project primarily depends on a running FastAPI server to perform the checks. For convenience, you can create a separate folder outside of the opened PyCharm project and write the solutions for each stage there. Make sure the server is running and has the described logic implemented before submitting each stage for checking.</p></div><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><ul><li><p>Set up a FastAPI service with a <code class="language-shell">AI Diet &amp; Meal Planner</code> title.</p></li><li><p>Create a single root endpoint (<code class="language-shell">GET/</code>) that returns the following JSON: <code class="language-shell">{"message": "Success!"}</code>.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the FastAPI server can run with Uvicorn on port <code class="language-shell">8000</code> using auto-reload mode.</p></li><li><p>Check that the service correctly handles and returns JSON responses.</p></li></ul><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>Request:</p><pre><code class="language-shell"># sample curl request
curl -i http://localhost:8000/</code></pre><p>Expected Response:</p><pre><code class="language-json">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
{"message":"Success!"}</code></pre><p>To submit this stage for a test, you have to run the FastAPI server from the terminal with the following command (here, main is the name of the file, <a href="https://main.py" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">main.py</a>, and app is the previously defined name of the FastAPI server):</p><pre><code class="language-shell">uvicorn main:app --reload</code></pre><p>Once the server is running, you can submit the solution. Note that the test assumes the FastAPI server is running on <a href="https://localhost" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">localhost</a> and port 8000.</p>
